                <p>Here is a collection of my favorite Web sites, organized by general catagories. Check them out and feel free to contact me with suggestions or problems. Here are the categories.</p>

                <section>
                    <ul id="favShortCut">
                        <li><a href="#fav1">Favorite Movie Streaming Services </a></li>
                        <li><a href="#fav2">Favorite PC Distribution Services</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#fav3">Favorite People in History</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="fav1">Favorite Movie Streaming Services</h2>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><a href="https://www.crackle.com/">Sony's Crackle</a></dt>
                        <dd>Contains a collection of Sony movies/TV shows which are supported by ads. Currently has some of my favorite movies, Resident Evil and Underworld.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Video/b?node=2676882011">Amazon Prime Video</a></dt>
                        <dd>Contains many TV shows and movies that are available with just an Amazon Prime subscription. In addition there exist many channel subscriptions from networks such as HBO,Showtime, and Cinemax that have their own material available for a monthly subscription.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <h2 id="fav2">Favorite PC Distribution Services</h2>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Valve's Steam</a></dt>
                        <dd>Contains a massive library from AAA to independent games. Steam has sales every 6 months for Summer and Winter.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="https://www.gog.com/">Good Old Games</a></dt>
                        <dd>Has a good library of games, but not as extensive as Steam. The biggest bonus is that none of the games contain any DRM software restricting the user's ability to use the install file as they wish.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <h2 id="fav3">Favorite People in History</h2>

                        <dd>No person has left a greater impact on my life than when I came to faith in Jesus. He provided stability in my life and hope at a time when I was lost.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="https://www.biography.com/people/abraham-lincoln-9382540" >Abe Lincoln</a></dt>
                        <dd>Abe Lincoln is one of the most influential historical characters in my life. The challenges he faced, and that he overcame has inspired me to a great deal. He went from having no more than a year of formal education to then becoming one of the United States most influential Presidents.</dd>
